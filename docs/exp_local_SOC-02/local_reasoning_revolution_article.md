## The Economic Revolution: Local vs Cloud

### Cost Transformation
The most striking finding of our local deployment was the dramatic cost reduction:

| Metric | Local DeepSeek-R1:32b | Cloud GPT-4o-mini (Estimate) | Savings |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------------|---------|
