Alright, I need to help this user create a research document for analysis based on their query. Let me start by understanding exactly what they want.

The user provided an input which is a simple description of what it means to be an AI. They also have previous outputs that include some detailed responses and internal reasoning. My task is to clean and structure this into a markdown version, removing any formatting artifacts and standardizing the section headers.

Looking at their example response, they want a clear markdown document with specific sections like Task Description, Previous Outputs, Constraints, and Internal Reasoning. Each of these sections should be properly formatted with headers that are standardized, probably using bold for section titles and headers within.

I notice in their previous outputs, there's a 'previous_outputs' key which is an array containing another object. That's helpful because it shows multiple responses from different sources. I'll need to include both the user's input and the examples they provided, ensuring that each section flows logically.

In the Task Description, I should define AI concisely but comprehensively. The previous response already does this by explaining what AI is, its purpose, and some definitions like narrow vs. generative AI. That's a solid foundation. I'll make sure to include that here, keeping it clear and concise.

For the Previous Outputs section, I need to list each example with their respective responses and scores. The user provided two examples: answer_17 and duckduckgo_18. Each has a response, confidence score, and internal reasoning. I should format them under "previous_outputs" as sub-sections, but wait, the structure is 'prev outputs' which seems to include both the task and the previous outputs.

Alright, I need to help this user create a research document for analysis based on their query. Let me start by understanding exactly what they want.

The user provided an input which is a simple description of what it means to be an AI. They also have previous outputs that include some detailed responses and internal reasoning. My task is to clean and structure this into a markdown version, removing any formatting artifacts and standardizing the section headers.

Looking at their example response, they want a clear markdown document with specific sections like Task Description, Previous Outputs, Constraints, and Internal Reasoning. Each of these sections should be properly formatted with headers that are standardized, probably using bold for section titles and headers within.

I notice in their previous outputs, there's a 'previous_outputs' key which is an array containing another object. That's helpful because it shows multiple responses from different sources. I'll need to include both the user's input and the examples they provided, ensuring that each section flows logically.

In the Task Description, I should define AI concisely but comprehensively. The previous response already does this by explaining what AI is, its purpose, and some definitions like narrow vs. generative AI. That's a solid foundation. I'll make sure to include that here, keeping it clear and concise.

For the Previous Outputs section, I need to list each example with their respective responses and scores. The user provided two examples: answer_17 and duckduckgo_18. Each has a response, confidence score, and internal reasoning. I should format them under "previous_outputs" as sub-sections, but wait, the structure is 'prev outputs' which seems to include both the task and the previous outputs.

Hmm, perhaps I misread that. In their initial query, they have a markdown example with a task description, then another section labeled 'previous_outputs'. Inside that, there are two bullet points each listing answer_17 and duckduckgo_18. Each of these has their response, confidence, and internal reasoning.

So, I need to structure the markdown accordingly: first the Task Description in a bolded section, followed by a header for "prev outputs", then under that, two bullet points each containing the details from answer_17 and duckduckgo_18. Each of these bullets will have their respective sections.

I should also make sure the headers are consistent‚Äîbold for main headers like Task Description, prev Outputs, etc.‚Äîand each section is properly indented with a hyphen. Also, the internal reasoning under each bullet needs to be concise but informative.

Let me outline the structure:

1. Task Description
   - Section 1: Definition of AI
      - Subsection: What does it mean? (definition)
      - Subsection: Definitions (narrow vs generative AI)
        - Subsection: Narrow AI (Weak AI)
          - Example: Video games, personal assistants
          - Response from answer_17
        - Subsection: Generative AI
          - Example: Creating text, images
          - Response from duckduckgo_18
   - Section 2: Scope and Application
      - Subsection: Types of AI (narrow vs generative)
      - Subsection: Applications across industries

Wait, the previous outputs have bullet points for each source. So under 'prev outputs', I should list both answer_17 and duckduckgo_18, each with their response, confidence score, and internal reasoning.

I think that's all the necessary sections. Now, putting it together in markdown format with headers and proper structure.

Let me double-check for any formatting issues. Each section starts with a bolded title, followed by an optional subtitle in parentheses if needed. The bullet points under 'prev outputs' should be correctly formatted with each point having its own sub-bullet sections.

I also need to ensure that the confidence scores are correctly placed under their respective responses and that internal reasoning is clear and concise for analysis.

Once I have all these elements, the markdown will be clean and well-structured as requested.
